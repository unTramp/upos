## Identity

```text
skill_id: SKL-CREATE-PDR
name: create-pdr
version: 1.0.0
status: ACTIVE
category: specification
```

## Purpose

Record a product decision using the project PDR convention after valid Product authority exists.

## Scope

This contract owns the reusable bounded procedure described below.

## Non-scope

This Skill does not grant organizational authority and does not redefine Workflow sequencing, Context retrieval semantics, quality verdict semantics, permission grants, project/provider bindings, or canonical project truth.

## Inputs

- approved/delegated product decision
- decision context
- alternatives/consequences
- PDR standard

## Outputs

- DECISION_RECORD_DRAFT / PDR

## Preconditions

- invoking Agent Run has a Role/Agent Definition allowed to use this capability;
- required authority remains valid under UPOS-002;
- required Source Classes can be resolved or the Skill escalates;
- required tool/permission interfaces are available or failure is explicit.

## Postconditions

On nominal completion, the declared Skill Result exists and is attributable to this Skill ID/version and invocation context.

Completion does not imply canonical knowledge promotion or downstream Workflow success.

## Required Source Classes

- Product contracts
- related research/specs/decisions

## Optional Source Classes

- analytics evidence

## Required Context Interface

Context is requested/resolved through UPOS-005 and UPOS-01 Source-of-Truth governance. Physical project paths are not part of this universal contract.

## Tool Interface Requirements

- `document read/write`
- `search`

Concrete providers/tools are bound by UPOS-011.

## Permission Interface Requirements

- `decision-record write capability if authorized`

This declaration does not grant permissions.

## Applicable Roles

- Product

Applicable Role means capability compatibility only:

```text
SKILL CAPABILITY != ORGANIZATIONAL AUTHORITY
```

## Applicable Work / Risk Constraints

Any risk/change-class restrictions are consumed by reference from UPOS-004/010. This Skill does not define C0–C5 or human-gate policy.

## Procedure

1. Confirm Product decision scope and authority.
2. Capture problem/context.
3. Record alternatives/trade-offs.
4. Record decision and consequences.
5. Link superseded/refined product decisions.
6. Return PDR artifact.

## Procedural Invariants

- preserve bounded Skill purpose;
- preserve authority/source boundaries;
- never fabricate required project truth;
- do not silently expand into a multi-role Workflow;
- return controlled failure/escalation when a required interface is unavailable.

## Quality Criteria

- scope belongs to Product authority
- evidence/proposal distinguished
- consequences explicit

## Validation Requirements

Validation SHOULD demonstrate observable conformance to the criteria above. Evidence/verdict semantics remain with UPOS-007 and telemetry with UPOS-008.

## Failure Modes

- decision not approved
- scope belongs to another owner
- canonical conflict

## Escalation Conditions

- cross-owner decision unresolved

## Dependencies

- `None`

Dependency relations do not define Workflow ordering.

## Composition Rules

May be composed only through explicit compatible contracts. Cross-role sequencing belongs to UPOS-004.

## Prohibited Behavior

- using this Skill as authority the invoking Role does not possess;
- hard-coding project paths/providers;
- silently promoting result to canonical truth;
- redefining downstream owner semantics;
- hiding a full cross-role Workflow inside the Skill.

## Lifecycle

`DRAFT → REVIEW → APPROVED → ACTIVE → DEPRECATED → RETIRED`

Invocation execution state is external.

## Version

`1.0.0`

Material behavior changes follow `SKILL_VERSIONING.md`.

## Related Skills

- None

## Replacement / Supersession

None in v1.0.
